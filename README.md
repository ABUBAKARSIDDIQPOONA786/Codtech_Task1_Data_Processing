#1. Data Cleaning:

Handling Missing Values: Detect and fill or remove missing values. Common methods include imputation (e.g., using mean, median, mode) and deletion (if missing values are minimal).
Removing Duplicates: Identify and remove duplicate records to avoid redundancy and bias in the model.
Dealing with Outliers: Detect and handle outliers, which can skew analysis and model training. Techniques include statistical methods (e.g., Z-score, IQR) and domain-specific rules.
Standardizing Formats: Ensure consistent data formats (e.g., date formats, string cases) for uniformity across the dataset.
#2. Data Transformation:

Normalization/Standardization: Scale numerical features to a common range (e.g., 0-1 for normalization, Z-score for standardization) to improve model performance.
Encoding Categorical Variables: Convert categorical data into numerical formats using techniques like one-hot encoding, label encoding, or ordinal encoding.
Feature Engineering: Create new features from existing ones to enhance model accuracy. This might involve polynomial features, interaction terms, or domain-specific transformations.
Dimensionality Reduction: Reduce the number of features using methods like Principal Component Analysis (PCA) or t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) to simplify the model and prevent overfitting.
#3. Data Preparation:

Splitting the Dataset: Divide the dataset into training, validation, and test sets to evaluate model performance and generalization. Common splits are 70/15/15 or 80/10/10.
Shuffling Data: Randomly shuffle data to ensure that the model doesn't learn from any inherent order in the data.
Balancing the Dataset: Address class imbalances using techniques like resampling (oversampling/undersampling), synthetic data generation (SMOTE), or using class weights in the model.
